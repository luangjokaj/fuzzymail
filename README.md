### Development
Start development server:
```
npm run dev
```

### Templating and HTML Partials
To avoid repetitive HTML code, FuzzyMail uses [gulp-file-include](https://github.com/haoxins/gulp-file-include). It has a simple templating synthax and allows to re-use chunks of code written in separate files. These partials are located in the directory:
```
src/includes/
```
For more information check out their documentation and examples: https://github.com/haoxins/gulp-file-include 


### Production
To build the production templates:
```
npm run prod
```
All styles will be inlined, ready to upload the generated ZIP on mailchimp or else ðŸš€
